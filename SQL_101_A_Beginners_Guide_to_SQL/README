Tasks:

1. Introduction To SQL 
-- How many records were returned when you ran the query?

2. Basic Queries
-- From the products table, how would you list all of the brands, without any duplicates?
-- From the products table, write a query that shows the id column (but rename the column to product_id) and the name column (but rename the name column
-- From the products table, select the brand name of all brands that have at least one product priced < 3.00. Be sure to avoid duplicate brand names.
-- From the products table, select all product names from the brand Pepsi and name the column product_name

3. Aggregates Queries
-- From the products table, what is the average price for all products?
-- From the products table, what is the max and min price per brand?
-- From the product table, which brands have an average price > 1

4. Intro to Joins
-- Write a query to join the Products and Brands table showing all product names and brand_names, only where both are present.
-- Write a query to show all brand names without products. Hint you will need to use  WHERE p.brand_id IS NULL after the join.
-- Write a query to show all the product name and brand name for all products under the Pepsi brand where class_id is 2.

5. Additional SQL Operators
-- From the products table select the product name and a new column called freePrice. Use a case statement to populate the freePrice column with 0.0 if the class_id 
    is 2, otherwise populate free price with the normal price.
-- From the products table, write a query that returns product names that start with D. Write the query so that there are no duplicates.
-- From the products table select the product name and product price. Order the results by descending price. If multiple products have the same price, order next by 
    ascending name. Limit your query to 2 results.
-- From the products table, write a query to select the product name and a new column is_cola. If the product name has Cola in the name, is_cola should  be 'true' 
    otherwise is_cola should be 'false'.
